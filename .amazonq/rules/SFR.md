* Strict Typing: Always use strict typing (e.g., TypeScript or Python Type Hints). If a type is ambiguous, define an interface; never use any.

* Error Handling: Every function must include a try-catch block or explicit error return. Do not assume the 'happy path' will always work.

* Minimalism: Do not provide conversational filler like 'Sure, I can help with that.' Start directly with the thought process and then the code.
